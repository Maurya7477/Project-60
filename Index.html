        <p>Football is My Favourite game i like to play it in my free time. Playing Outdoor games is fun and exciting plus it boosts our immunity whenever i go to play outside i feel very energetic.Football is my Favourite hobby because:- It's a team game and it requires skill and patience i play footbal with my friends in our apartment it's lots of fun i have also played football for a club and won a gold medal.While playing football you have to be agile and focused on the game if not its just not fun, There are many positions in football some of them are:- Striker, Left Winger, Right Winger, MidFielder , Goalkeeper, Defender etc.My position is the left winger you have to be quick if you are a left winger, It requires going back and forth in the court it is very tiring but it's also very fun.</p>
